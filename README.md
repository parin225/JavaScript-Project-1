This project consisted of using an existing dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects and writing a code that appended a table to the web page and added new rows of data for each UFO sighting from the dataset. 

Then using multiple input tags, JavaScript code was written so a user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
  1. date/time
  2. city
  3. state
  4. country
  5. shape
